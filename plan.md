# Plan

## ~~1. Include test source set in cnavInterfaces (High value)~~ DONE

`cnavInterfaces` now supports `-Pincludetest=true` to also scan test class directories. This reveals test fakes (e.g., `FakeRepo`, `StubClient`) alongside production implementations. Uses a separate cache file (`interface-registry-all.cache`) when test classes are included to avoid mixing results.

## ~~2. True tree indentation for cnavCallers/cnavCallees (High value)~~ DONE

Already implemented. `CallTreeFormatter.renderTree()` recursively walks callers/callees up to `maxDepth`, increasing indentation at each level. Cycle detection via `visited` set prevents infinite recursion. Tests cover transitive nesting, depth limits, and cycles.

## ~~3. "No packages found" message for cnavDeps with invalid filter (Low effort, high polish)~~ DONE

Already implemented in `PackageDepsTask.kt:26-29`.

## ~~4. Reverse dependency view for cnavDeps (High value)~~ DONE

`cnavDeps` now supports `-Preverse=true` to show reverse dependencies (who depends on each package). Uses a lazy inverted map in `PackageDependencies.dependentsOf()`. `allPackages()` and `findPackages()` include all packages (both sources and targets of dependencies) so packages with only incoming dependencies also appear. Output uses `←` arrows for reverse mode and shows "(no incoming dependencies)" when a package has no dependents.

## ~~5. Filter out stdlib/JDK noise in cnavCallees and cnavDeps (Medium value)~~ DONE

cnavCallees, cnavCallers, and cnavDeps now support `-Pprojectonly=true` to filter output to project classes only, hiding JDK/stdlib/library noise. Uses `CallGraph.projectClasses()` (derived from scanned source files) to determine what's "project" vs "external".

## 6. Architecture violation detection in cnavDeps (High value, ambitious)

Allow defining allowed/forbidden dependency rules (e.g., "services must not depend on ra") and flag violations. This would turn cnavDeps into an architecture fitness function. Could be configured via a simple DSL:

```kotlin
codeNavigator {
    rules {
        "services" mustNotDependOn "ra"
        "domain" mustNotDependOn "ktor"
    }
}
```

## ~~7. JSON/machine-readable output format (Medium value)~~ DONE

All tasks now support `-Pformat=json` for structured JSON output. Hand-rolled JSON formatter (`JsonFormatter.kt`) with no external dependencies — uses `jsonArray`, `jsonObject`, `jsonValue` helpers and a `JsonRaw` value class for pre-rendered content. Covers all 8 data tasks: cnavListClasses, cnavFindClass, cnavFindSymbol, cnavClass, cnavCallers, cnavCallees, cnavInterfaces, cnavDeps. Also added `cnavAgentHelp` task with workflow guidance, task reference, and performance tips for AI coding agents.

## ~~8. cnavClass show interfaces implemented (Low effort)~~ DONE

Already implemented. `ClassDetailExtractor` extracts interfaces from bytecode and `ClassDetailFormatter` outputs "Implements: ..." when interfaces are present.

## 9. Write JSON output to file instead of stdout (Medium value)

When `-Pformat=json` is used, write the JSON to a file (e.g., under `build/cnav/`) and print the file path to stdout. Agents and scripts can then read the file directly instead of parsing Gradle's stdout, which mixes task output with Gradle lifecycle noise (e.g., `> Task :cnavCallers`, configuration cache messages). This makes the JSON output reliable regardless of Gradle's verbosity settings.

## 10. Maven plugin support (High value)

Create a Maven plugin equivalent in the same repo. The core bytecode analysis logic (scanning, call graph building, formatting) is build-tool-agnostic — it operates on `.class` file directories. Factor the core into a shared module and wire it into both a Gradle plugin and a Maven plugin (Mojo). This would make code-navigator available to the large Maven user base without duplicating the analysis code.

## 11. Git log infrastructure — foundation for behavioral analysis (High value)

Inspired by Code Maat / CodeScene. All git-history-based analyses share a common parsing layer:

- `GitLogRunner` — executes `git log --all --numstat --date=short --pretty=format:'--%h--%ad--%aN' --no-renames --after=<date>` via `ProcessBuilder`. Uses the Code Maat `git2` format for tolerant, fast parsing.
- `GitLogParser` — parses raw git log output into `List<GitCommit>` data class: hash, date, author, list of `FileChange(added: Int, deleted: Int, path: String)`.
- Shared parameter: `-Pafter=YYYY-MM-DD` to limit the temporal window (default: 1 year). Matches Code Maat's recommendation to avoid old data confounding analysis.
- No new dependencies — just `ProcessBuilder` + string parsing.
- These tasks do NOT depend on `classes` — they read git history, not bytecode, so they work even before compilation.

Architecture follows the existing three-layer pattern:
1. **Parsing**: `GitLogParser` (shared) produces `List<GitCommit>`
2. **Resolution**: One builder per analysis produces its result data structure
3. **Formatting**: Text/JSON/LLM formatters per analysis, using existing `OutputFormat` and `OutputWrapper`

Each builder is independently testable with synthetic `GitCommit` lists (no git repo needed in tests), mirroring how existing tests use synthetic `CallGraph` instances.

## 12. `cnavHotspots` — change frequency analysis (High value)

Inspired by Code Maat's `revisions` analysis. Ranks files by how often they change. The most-changed files are where development effort concentrates — if they also have structural problems (visible via `cnavDeps`, `cnavCallers`), they're priority refactoring targets.

- `HotspotBuilder.build(commits) -> List<Hotspot(file, revisions, totalChurn)>`
- Parameters: `-Pafter=YYYY-MM-DD`, `-Pmin-revs=N` (default 1), `-Ptop=N` (default 50)
- Text table (File | Revisions | Churn), JSON, LLM formatters
- Sorted by revision count descending

## 13. `cnavCoupling` — change coupling / logical coupling (High value)

Inspired by Code Maat's `coupling` analysis. Finds files that change together in the same commits — implicit dependencies invisible in call graphs. Complements structural `cnavDeps` with behavioral coupling data.

- `ChangeCouplingBuilder.build(commits, minSharedRevs, minCoupling, maxChangesetSize) -> List<CoupledPair(entity, coupled, degree, sharedRevs, avgRevs)>`
- Degree = (shared commits / avg individual commits) × 100
- Large changeset filtering (default: skip commits touching >30 files) — these are usually automated refactorings/renames and create misleading coupling signals. This is a Code Maat best practice.
- Parameters: `-Pafter`, `-Pmin-shared-revs=N` (default 5), `-Pmin-coupling=N` (default 30%), `-Pmax-changeset-size=N` (default 30), `-Ppattern=<regex>` to filter to specific files
- Text table (Entity | Coupled | Degree% | Shared Revs), JSON, LLM formatters

## 14. `cnavAge` — code age analysis (Medium value)

Inspired by Code Maat's `age` analysis. Measures time since last modification per file. Stable old code is good; frequently-changing old code with structural problems is a hotspot. One way to measure the stability of a software architecture.

- `CodeAgeBuilder.build(commits) -> List<FileAge(file, ageMonths, lastChangeDate)>`
- Parameters: `-Pafter` (for filtering which files to consider), `-Ptop=N`
- Sorted by age descending (oldest/most stable first)
- Text table (File | Age (months) | Last Changed), JSON, LLM formatters

## 15. `cnavAuthors` — authors per module (Medium value)

Inspired by Code Maat's `authors` analysis. Number of distinct contributors per file — the more developers working on a module, the larger the communication challenges. High author counts correlate with defects and quality issues.

- `AuthorAnalysisBuilder.build(commits) -> List<ModuleAuthors(file, authors: Int, revisions: Int)>`
- Parameters: `-Pafter`, `-Pmin-revs=N`, `-Ptop=N`
- Sorted by author count descending
- Text table (File | Authors | Revisions), JSON, LLM formatters

## 16. `cnavChurn` — code churn analysis (Medium value)

Inspired by Code Maat's `abs-churn` and `entity-churn` analyses. Pre-release churn of a module is a good predictor of post-release defects. Measures lines added/deleted per file.

- `ChurnBuilder.build(commits) -> List<FileChurn(file, added: Int, deleted: Int, commits: Int)>`
- Parameters: `-Pafter`, `-Ptop=N`, optional `-Pby-date=true` for daily aggregation
- Sorted by total churn (added + deleted) descending
- Text table (File | Added | Deleted | Net | Commits), JSON, LLM formatters

## 17. Refactor Gradle tasks to use Config data classes (Medium value, low effort)

Gradle tasks currently duplicate parameter parsing logic that Config data classes already have. Each task should build a `Map<String, String?>` from `project.findProperty()` calls and delegate to `XxxConfig.parse()`. This removes duplication and ensures Gradle and Maven use identical parsing/validation.

## 18. Extract and test task-specific side effects (Low effort, high polish)

- `FindInterfaceImplsTask` cache-file naming logic (choosing `interface-registry-all.cache` vs `interface-registry.cache` based on `includetest`) should be extracted to a pure function.
- `DsmTask` HTML file writing should be extracted so the HTML generation is testable without file I/O.

## 19. Gradle TestKit integration test for CodeNavigatorPlugin (Medium value)

Verify all 15 tasks are registered with correct groups and dependencies using Gradle TestKit. Currently there are no tests that verify the plugin wiring itself.

## 20. Create remaining Maven Mojos (High value)

Only `ListClassesMojo` exists. All other task equivalents need Maven Mojos:
- Navigation: `FindClass`, `FindSymbol`, `ClassDetail`, `FindCallers`, `FindCallees`, `FindInterfaceImpls`, `PackageDeps`, `Dsm`
- Analysis: `Hotspots`, `Churn`, `CodeAge`, `AuthorAnalysis`, `ChangeCoupling`
- Help: `Help`, `AgentHelp`, `ConfigHelp`

## 21. Maven release process (Medium value)

Define and document the Maven plugin release process, separate from the Gradle release. The Maven plugin has its own version (`0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`) and will be released independently.

## 22. Gradle/Maven parity testing (High value)

Ensure both plugins support the same commands, parameters, and produce equivalent output. Approaches to consider:
- **Shared task registry**: A single source-of-truth list of all supported tasks/goals with their parameters, used by both plugins. If a task is missing from either plugin, the build (or a test) fails.
- **Approval tests**: Run the same operation via both `./gradlew cnavXxx` and `./mvnw cnav:xxx` against the test project and compare outputs. Differences indicate parity gaps.
- **Config parse coverage**: Since both plugins delegate to the same `XxxConfig.parse()` functions, parity at the config layer is already guaranteed. The risk is in the Mojo/Task wiring — forgetting to wire a parameter or misnaming a goal.
- **Generated documentation**: Auto-generate the parameter table (like `ConfigHelpText`) from the config data classes so docs can't drift from implementation.

## 23. `cnavXray` — function-level hotspots (Very high value)

Inspired by CodeScene's "X-Ray" feature. File-level hotspots are too coarse — a large file may have one or two methods that account for most churn. X-Ray drills into git diff hunks and maps them to methods (using bytecode line number tables) to produce method-level hotspot rankings.

- **Question**: "Which specific methods within a file are causing the most churn?"
- **Needs**: Git history + bytecode (line number tables from class files to map hunks to methods)
- **Builder**: `XRayBuilder.build(commits, classDir, targetFile) -> List<MethodHotspot(className, methodName, revisions, churn)>`
- **Parameters**: `-Pfile=<path>` (required — X-Ray a specific file), `-Pafter=YYYY-MM-DD`, `-Ptop=N`
- **Why high value**: Far more actionable than file-level hotspots for AI agents suggesting refactoring. Since we already have call graph infrastructure and git log parsing, this reuses both.

## 24. `cnavCycles` — dependency cycle detection (High value, low effort)

Detect and report circular dependencies between packages (or classes). We already compute the DSM which can visualize cycles, but an explicit cycle detection task reports them directly — much more useful for automation and AI agents than reading a matrix.

- **Question**: "Are there circular dependencies that should be broken?"
- **Needs**: Bytecode only (reuses existing `DsmDependencyExtractor` and `PackageDependencyBuilder`)
- **Builder**: `CycleDetector.findCycles(packageDeps) -> List<Cycle(packages: List<String>)>` — uses Tarjan's algorithm or DFS
- **Parameters**: `-Proot-package=<prefix>`, `-Pincludetest=true`
- **Output**: Each cycle listed with the packages involved, sorted by cycle length
- **Why high value**: Cycle detection is one of the most requested architecture checks (ArchUnit, NDepend, Structure101 all feature it). Low effort since we already have the dependency graph.

## 25. `cnavCohesion` — class cohesion / LCOM (High value)

Measures Lack of Cohesion of Methods (LCOM) per class. Analyzes which methods access which instance fields from bytecode. A class where methods cluster into distinct groups that don't share fields has low cohesion — it's doing too many things and should be split.

- **Question**: "Which classes are doing too many things and should be split?"
- **Needs**: Bytecode only (field access patterns from ASM visitor)
- **Builder**: `CohesionAnalyzer.analyze(classDir) -> List<ClassCohesion(className, lcom: Int, methodCount: Int, fieldCount: Int, clusters: Int)>`
- **Parameters**: `-Pfilter=<regex>`, `-Pmin-methods=N` (skip trivial classes, default 3), `-Ptop=N`
- **Output**: Classes ranked by LCOM descending. Optionally show the method/field clusters.
- **Why high value**: Strong signal for refactoring. Computable from bytecode we already parse. One of CodeScene's "code health" factors.

## 26. `cnavRank` — type/method importance ranking via PageRank (High value, low effort)

Apply PageRank to the existing call graph to identify the most "load-bearing" types and methods. Types with high rank are depended upon transitively by many others — a bug there is most catastrophic.

- **Question**: "Which types/methods are the most critical in the codebase?"
- **Needs**: Bytecode only (reuses existing call graph)
- **Builder**: `TypeRanker.rank(callGraph) -> List<RankedType(className, rank: Double, inDegree: Int, outDegree: Int)>`
- **Parameters**: `-Ptop=N` (default 30), `-Pprojectonly=true`, `-Pmethods=true` (rank methods instead of types)
- **Why high value**: Useful for AI agents to understand which classes are central vs peripheral. Also useful for prioritizing test coverage. Easy to implement since we already build the call graph.

## 27. `cnavDead` — dead code detection (High value, low effort)

Identify classes, methods, or fields that are never referenced by any other code in the project. Reports "potential dead code" since reflection-based usage can't be detected from bytecode alone.

- **Question**: "What code can safely be removed?"
- **Needs**: Bytecode only (reuses existing call graph and symbol index)
- **Builder**: `DeadCodeFinder.find(callGraph, symbolIndex, classIndex) -> List<DeadCode(className, memberName?, kind: CLASS|METHOD|FIELD)>`
- **Parameters**: `-Pfilter=<regex>`, `-Pinclude-fields=true`, `-Pexclude=<regex>` (exclude known entry points like `main`, `@Test`, Mojo/Task classes)
- **Caveats**: Must document that reflection, serialization, and framework magic (Spring beans, etc.) may cause false positives.
- **Why high value**: Very actionable for cleanup. AI agents can suggest removal with confidence when bytecode analysis shows zero references.

## 28. Complexity trends over time (High value, medium effort)

Track the complexity of hotspot files across git history. Instead of a snapshot, show whether a file is *deteriorating*, *stable*, or *improving*. Uses indentation-based complexity (proxy for cyclomatic complexity, works without full parsing) measured at each historical version.

- **Question**: "Is this hotspot getting harder to maintain over time, or are we keeping it under control?"
- **Needs**: Git history (fetches file content at historical versions via `git show`)
- **Builder**: `ComplexityTrendBuilder.build(file, commits) -> List<ComplexityPoint(date, complexity, revisionHash)>`
- **Parameters**: `-Pfile=<path>` (required), `-Pafter=YYYY-MM-DD`, `-Psamples=N` (number of historical points)
- **Could extend**: `cnavHotspots` with a `-Ptrend=true` flag, or be a standalone `cnavTrend` task
- **Why high value**: The direction of complexity change is more informative than an absolute value. A rising-complexity hotspot is the #1 refactoring target.

## 29. Coupling comparison — temporal vs structural (High value, medium effort)

Compare temporal coupling (files that change together, from git) with structural coupling (files that depend on each other, from bytecode). The mismatches are where the most interesting architectural insights hide:

- **Temporal coupling WITHOUT structural coupling** → hidden dependencies (shared config, copy-paste, implicit contracts)
- **Structural coupling WITHOUT temporal coupling** → potentially unused/dead dependencies

- **Question**: "Are there hidden dependencies not visible in the code structure?"
- **Needs**: Both git history and bytecode
- **Builder**: `CouplingComparisonBuilder.build(temporalCoupling, structuralDeps) -> List<CouplingMismatch(fileA, fileB, temporalDegree, structurallyLinked: Boolean, kind: HIDDEN_DEP|UNUSED_DEP)>`
- **Parameters**: Same as `cnavCoupling` + bytecode class dirs
- **Why high value**: Genuinely novel analysis from Tornhill's "Software Design X-Rays" that no other build plugin offers. Extremely useful for AI agents reasoning about refactoring.

## 30. Knowledge distribution / bus factor (Medium-high value, low effort)

Extends `cnavAuthors` with proportional ownership. Instead of just counting distinct contributors, compute each developer's share of contributions per file. Identifies "knowledge islands" where a single developer wrote >80% of the code.

- **Question**: "If developer X leaves, what parts of the codebase are at risk?"
- **Needs**: Git history only
- **Builder**: `KnowledgeDistributionBuilder.build(commits) -> List<FileOwnership(file, mainAuthor, mainAuthorShare: Double, totalAuthors: Int, busFactor: Int)>`
- **Parameters**: `-Pafter`, `-Ptop=N`, `-Prisk-threshold=N` (percentage, default 80)
- **Could extend**: `cnavAuthors` with a `-Pownership=true` flag
- **Why useful**: For AI agents, knowing who the expert is for a given file is immediately actionable. For teams, bus factor risks are critical planning info.

## 31. Stability/instability metrics — Robert C. Martin (Medium-high value, low effort)

For each package, compute Afferent Coupling (Ca = who depends on me), Efferent Coupling (Ce = who I depend on), Instability I = Ce/(Ca+Ce), and Abstractness A = abstract types / total types. The "distance from main sequence" D = |A + I - 1| measures how well a package balances stability and abstractness.

- **Question**: "Are our package dependencies well-structured?"
- **Needs**: Bytecode only (extends `package-deps` data)
- **Builder**: `StabilityAnalyzer.analyze(packageDeps, classIndex) -> List<PackageMetrics(pkg, ca, ce, instability, abstractness, distance)>`
- **Parameters**: `-Proot-package=<prefix>`
- **Why useful**: Well-established Clean Architecture metrics. Packages in the "zone of pain" (stable + concrete) or "zone of uselessness" (unstable + abstract) are worth flagging.

## 32. Shotgun surgery detection (Medium-high value, medium effort)

Identify commits where a single logical change touches many files across many packages — a code smell indicating poor encapsulation. Aggregates git history to find recurring patterns of widespread changes.

- **Question**: "Which kinds of changes cause the most widespread ripple effects?"
- **Needs**: Git history (optionally enriched with bytecode package structure)
- **Builder**: `ShotgunSurgeryDetector.detect(commits, minFiles, minPackages) -> List<ShotgunCommit(hash, date, author, filesChanged, packagesChanged, files: List<String>)>`
- **Parameters**: `-Pafter`, `-Pmin-files=N` (default 8), `-Pmin-packages=N` (default 3), `-Ptop=N`
- **Why useful**: Identifies poor encapsulation patterns. An AI agent could flag "this change pattern suggests concept X is spread across too many packages."

## 33. Refactoring targets — composite risk score (Medium value, medium effort)

Combine hotspot data (change frequency), code complexity (from bytecode or indentation), coupling degree, and author count into a single prioritized "refactoring score" per file. Answers the question every team lead asks: "where should we invest refactoring effort for maximum payoff?"

- **Question**: "What are the top refactoring targets in the codebase?"
- **Needs**: Both git history and bytecode
- **Builder**: `RefactoringTargetBuilder.build(hotspots, complexity, coupling, authors) -> List<RefactoringTarget(file, score, components: Map<String, Double>)>`
- **Parameters**: `-Pafter`, `-Ptop=N`, weights for each factor
- **Depends on**: Multiple other analyses (hotspots, cohesion, coupling, authors)
- **Why useful**: The "killer feature" of CodeScene — combining signals into an actionable priority list.

## 34. Layer violation detection (Medium value, medium effort)

Given user-defined architectural layers (e.g., controller → service → persistence), detect violations where a lower layer depends on a higher one. Provides a declarative way to check layer rules without writing ArchUnit test code.

- **Question**: "Does the code respect our intended architectural boundaries?"
- **Needs**: Bytecode only
- **Configuration**: Layer definitions in build config (e.g., `cnav.layers = ["controller", "service", "domain", "persistence"]`) or a properties file
- **Builder**: `LayerViolationDetector.detect(packageDeps, layerConfig) -> List<Violation(from, to, fromLayer, toLayer)>`
- **Why useful**: Architecture enforcement without requiring ArchUnit dependency or test code. More of a reporting/checking concern than analysis.

## 35. Knowledge loss / former contributor risk (Medium value, low effort)

Identify code primarily written by developers who are no longer active (haven't committed in N months). Flags modules where the dominant contributor has gone silent.

- **Question**: "Which parts of the codebase are maintained by people who may have left?"
- **Needs**: Git history only
- **Builder**: `KnowledgeLossDetector.detect(commits, inactiveMonths) -> List<AtRiskFile(file, mainAuthor, lastAuthorCommit, authorShare, isActive: Boolean)>`
- **Parameters**: `-Pinactive-months=N` (default 6), `-Ptop=N`
- **Why useful**: Risk assessment for team planning. Less actionable for AI agents day-to-day.

## 36. Developer coordination / fragmentation (Low-medium value, low effort)

Measures how scattered contributions are across a file. High fragmentation (many authors each contributing small pieces) correlates with higher defect risk compared to concentrated ownership. Extends Code Maat's `fragmentation` metric.

- **Question**: "Where are coordination bottlenecks in the codebase?"
- **Needs**: Git history only
- **Builder**: `FragmentationAnalyzer.analyze(commits) -> List<FileFragmentation(file, fragmentation: Double, authors: Int, revisions: Int)>`
- **Parameters**: `-Pafter`, `-Ptop=N`
- **Why useful**: More relevant for large teams. Can be combined with other metrics (hotspots, authors) for richer analysis.

## Future ideas (not yet planned)

- **Consider just failing on first file with wrong bytecode**: The current `ScanResult<T>` partial-fail approach adds complexity across scanners, caches, tasks, and mojos. A simpler alternative: fail fast on the first unsupported bytecode file with a clear error message. Less graceful but dramatically less code.
- **Expand support for older JDKs**: The plugin currently requires JDK 21+ (Gradle 9.x minimum). Explore lowering the bytecode target or supporting Gradle 8.x to reach projects still on JDK 17 or JDK 11.
- **Cross-referencing hotspots with bytecode data**: Combine `cnavHotspots` with `cnavCallers`/`cnavDeps` to answer "hotspot files and their structural dependencies". Would require mapping git file paths to bytecode class names via the source file metadata already extracted.
- **Entity ownership / main developer**: Who "owns" each file by contribution weight (`-a entity-ownership` and `-a main-dev` in Code Maat). Useful for "who should I ask about this code?" Could be added as a mode on `cnavAuthors`.
- **Architectural-level grouping**: Code Maat's `-g` flag to aggregate file-level results by logical component/layer. Would allow running hotspots, coupling, etc. at the sub-system level instead of individual files.
